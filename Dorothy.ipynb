        "\n",
        "### **Overview**\n",
        "This proposal outlines a vision for integrating GitHub with AI-assisted development tools, leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to create a dynamic and iterative development environment. The goal is to enhance productivity, enable traceability, and integrate human intuition into AI-generated suggestions, using GitHub as the foundation for collaboration and tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Bi-Directional RAG System for Code Development**\n",
        "A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system ensures the AI has access to the repository’s commit history, pull requests, issues, and documentation. This allows the AI to:\n",
        "- Suggest changes informed by prior development patterns.\n",
        "- Retrieve relevant context to justify decisions.\n",
        "- Provide continuity in style and architecture across the codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. RLHF Feedback Loop**\n",
        "GitHub workflows will act as a natural RLHF feedback mechanism:\n",
        "- **Proposed Changes**: AI suggests commits or pull requests, complete with justifications and impact analysis.\n",
