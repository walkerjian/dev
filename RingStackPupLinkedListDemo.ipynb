        "1. The **Basic Pup Operations** and **Overflow Test** sections work as expected.\n",
        "2. The **Underflow Test** now terminates correctly.\n",
        "3. The **Recognizable Test** showcases the functionality of the `Pup` function. The sentence \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" is pushed onto the stack. As the stack was initially empty, you see `�` (representing `#0`) for every pop during the push operations.\n",
        "4. In the second half of the **Recognizable Test**, we're trying to pop off every character from the stack. The stack is emptied in reverse order, which is expected behavior for a stack. Again, the `�` character represents a push of `#0` onto the stack, which is our signal to pop a character.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results are consistent with the expected behavior of a stack. The characters are pushed onto the stack in the order they appear in the sentence, and they are popped off in the reverse order. The `�` character simply represents our method of signaling a pop operation, and it's the visual representation of a non-printable character (`#0`).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you'd like, we can modify the output to replace `�` with a more user-friendly representation, such as `<empty>` or any other placeholder of your choice. Would you like to proceed with that modification?"
